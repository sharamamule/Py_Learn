Methods Exercise
Create a method, which takes the state and gross income as the arguments and returns the net income after 
   deducting tax based on the state.

Assume Federal Tax: 10%
Assume state tax on your wish.

You donâ€™t have to do for all the states, just take 3-4 to solve the purpose of the exercise.
